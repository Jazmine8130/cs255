Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass. They wanted an online setup where they could make appointments for new drivers as well as give them feedback on their driving to help pass their driving test. 
As well they wanted to be able to have the latest DMV updates to ensure their knowledge was correct. 

What did you do particularly well?
I oulined the needs very well and made a lot of notes. Since this was more likely an interview without notes i wanted to ensure every thing said was included so we didnt forget anything. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve the diagrams. I would spend more time adding more functions and things of other ways to ensure that all permissions were correct. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I read the transcripts many times to ensure clarity. Then i started making notes of what the client specifically asked for and the challenges or benefits of it. If the end product does not
implement the users needs, they wont use it. It will lead to a bad reputation and a bad product. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would focus on the needs and ensuring its a quality product. Being able to see how the system will be used or who is using it can be helpful in deisgning the right system. Interviews and 
reviewing the current system are great at identifying where the current system falls short.
